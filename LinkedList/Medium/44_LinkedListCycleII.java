üë®‚Äçüíª Problem Statement:
Given the head of a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. 
Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. (0-indexed)

üßæ Example:
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: tail connects to node index 1

Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: tail connects to node index 0

Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: no cycle

/*
üß† Approach:
- Use Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm to check for a cycle.
- If a cycle is detected, calculate the cycle's length.
- Use two pointers to find the starting node of the cycle.
