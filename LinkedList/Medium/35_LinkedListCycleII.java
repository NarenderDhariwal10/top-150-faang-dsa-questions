üë®‚Äçüíª Problem Statement:
Given the head of a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. 
If there is no cycle, return null.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that 
can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer.

Do not modify the linked list.

üßæ Example:
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: Node with value 2 (cycle starts here)

Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: Node with value 1

Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: null

        // If no cycle
        if (length == 0) return null;

        // Step 2: Find the start node of the cycle
        ListNode first = head;
        ListNode second = head;

        // Move second ahead by cycle length

            second = second.next;

        // Move both at same pace, they'll meet at start of cycle

}

/*
üß† Approach:
- Use Floyd‚Äôs Tortoise and Hare algorithm to detect a cycle and find its length.
- Then move one pointer ahead by the length of the cycle.
- Move both pointers one step at a time. They will meet at the start of the cycle.
