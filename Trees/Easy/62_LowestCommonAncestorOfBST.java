üë®‚Äçüíª Problem Statement:
Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia:
"The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants 
(where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself)."

üßæ Example:
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
Output: 6

Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: 2 is an ancestor of 4.

class Solution {
    public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        // BST property: left < root < right
        if (p.val < root.val && q.val < root.val) {
            // LCA is in the left subtree
            return lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q);
        } else if (p.val > root.val && q.val > root.val) {
            // LCA is in the right subtree
            return lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q);
        } else {

            return root;
        }
    }

/*
üß† Approach:
Use BST property:
- If both p and q < root, go left
- If both p and q > root, go right
- Else current root is the LCA
